Billing for Pay-as-You-Go Plans will be based on usage of the SnapTrade API as calculated by the number of Connected Users during the billing period and the number of Manual Syncs initiated and successfully completed by Client during such billing period.\niii.   A minimum deposit payment of $0.50 USD may be required to capture payment information for subsequent billing under the Pas-as-You-Go Plan.\niv.
